Framework Softadastra

Generated Base Methods: Base methods are automatically generated for you. You just instantiate the classes and use them.

Welcome to our lightweight PHP mini-framework! This framework is designed to provide a simple yet powerful foundation for building web applications. Here's what you need to know:

Features:

1. Basic Routing: Easily define routes and map them to controller actions.

2. Environment Configuration: Load environment variables from a .env file for secure configuration.

3. Database Integration: Seamlessly connect to a MySQL database using PDO.

4. Model Layer: Abstracted model layer for interacting with the database.

5. Repository Pattern: Utilize the repository pattern for cleaner and more maintainable database access.

6. Entity Mapping: Automatically map database query results to entity objects.

7. Dynamic Setter Injection: Dynamically inject entity setters for flexibility and ease of use.

8. Entity Objects: Use entity objects to represent database records in your application.

How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Configure your environment variables in the .env file.

3. Define your routes in the Router class.

4. Create your models extending the BaseModel class.

5. Utilize repositories extending the QueryModel class for database operations.

6. Define your entity objects to represent database records.
